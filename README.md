# Static-malware-analysis
In this project, we will analyze malware-based PDF and DOC file. 

## Introduction
PDF and DOC format file is the one of the most common types of documents in the world. 

Let begin with PDF, PDF format files become a vector of attack. In the first project, we will try to analyze two suspicious PDF-based malware files by using REMnux tool. Potential risk in PDF from some supported content via keyword: Embedded JavaScript (/JS, /JavaScript, /XFA), embedded Flash (/RichMedia), embedded or external programs (/Launch, /EmbeddedFiles), interaction with websites (/URI, /SubmitForm).
